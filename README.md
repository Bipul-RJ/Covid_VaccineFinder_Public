# Covid_Vaccine_Finder
This script Checks the availability of vaccine in selected centers(As of now I have added 5 districts, user can select from this.). If an available center is found, It will send whatsapp message to the selected contacts(User can configure any number of whatsapp groups/names/numbers)
